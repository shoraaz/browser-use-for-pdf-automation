        3.  When a PDF is open in the browser's built-in viewer, you must download it. Find and click the 'download' button. This is usually an icon of a downward-pointing arrow.
        4.  Note where the files are downloaded (e.g., browser's default download location).
        5.  Once you have downloaded one or two brochures, stop and provide a summary of which links you clicked and what files you successfully downloaded, including their presumed download locations.
