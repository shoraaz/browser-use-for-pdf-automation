        Your goal is to find and download PDF brochures for 'Kotak Life Insurance'.

        1.  Go to google.com and search for "Kotak Life Insurance brochure PDF".
        2.  Analyze the search results. Click on links that are clearly for a PDF document. These links might end in '.pdf' or have text that says 'PDF'.
        3.  When a PDF is open in the browser's built-in viewer, you must download it. Find and click the 'download' button. This is usually an icon of a downward-pointing arrow.
        4.  Ensure the files are saved into the 'downloads' folder.
        5.  Once you have downloaded one or two brochures, stop and provide a summary of which links you clicked and what files you successfully downloaded.
